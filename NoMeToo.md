When contributing to the Go issue tracker, please **do not** make comments like this:

> +1

or

> :+1: 

or

> Me too.

or

> I too would like to see this issue fixed.

Such comments do not help fix issues. In fact, they make it harder by cluttering the discussion. The project admins will delete such comments as a matter of procedure (please don't be offended if we delete yours).

We understand the urge to make the comments. When we used Google Code's issue tracker, one could "star" an issue to indicate one's interest in seeing an issue resolved. On GitHub you can "react" to an issue comment, so the closest thing we have to "star" is to make a positive "reaction" to the top-level comment on an issue. This isn't very helpful, since we cannot sort issues by "reactions" (yet), but it's better than nothing.

Of course, **please do comment** if your "me too" comment includes information that might help resolve the issue. This includes reports like this:

> This issue also affects me on Windows 10 when running all.bat at revision c0ff33.

(Although there's no need to make such a comment if an identical comment already exists.)

Thanks!
