## Install package `golang`

The `golang` Debian package may have already made its way into your Ubuntu distribution. Try this:

```
$ sudo apt-get install golang
```

That is all you need to get `go` working on your system. (You can use `go env GOROOT` to be sure where the Go files are, if you're curious.) Don't forget to create your GOPATH.


## If that didn't work
