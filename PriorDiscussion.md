# Prior Discussion

## Background

This page links to prior discussion on various topics.

The page complements the [official FAQ](https://golang.org/doc/faq). While the official FAQ contains things which are frequently asked, this page contains things that have been repeatedly asked, but maybe not frequently. Or maybe these will graduate to the official FAQ later.

**Editors:** When editing this page, please don't change the titles of sections, as that breaks the #anchors in URLs. You can rearrange, though.
