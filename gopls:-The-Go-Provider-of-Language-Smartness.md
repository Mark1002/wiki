The gopls is an Language Server Protocol (LSP) server for Go.
The LSP allows any text editor to be extended with IDE-like features;
see https://langserver.org/ for details.

gopls is currently under active development by the Go team. The code is in the x/tools repository, in [golang.org/x/tools/internal/lsp](https://golang.org/x/tools/internal/lsp) and [golang.org/x/tools/cmd/gopls](https://golang.org/x/tools/cmd/gopls).

Because we are actively working on gopls, it is not stable or recommended for use yet. We will make an announcement when gopls is ready for release.

Contributions are welcome, but since development is so active, we request that you file an issue and claim it before starting to work on something. Otherwise, it is likely that we might already be working on a fix for your issue. There are some LSP issues already open on the [Go issue tracker](https://github.com/golang/go/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+x%2Ftools%2Finternal%2Flsp). Any issue without an assignee and with the label "Suggested" is fair game - just please assign yourself or comment on the issue before you begin working!

Questions can be directed toward [@stamblerre](https://github.com/stamblerre) or [@ianthehat](https://github.com/ianthehat).

For consistent updates on the development progress of gopls, see the notes from the golang-tools meetings (https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/golang-tools).
