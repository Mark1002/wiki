Go 1.11 adds an experimental port to WebAssembly.

WebAssembly is described on its [home page](https://webassembly.org) as:

> WebAssembly (abbreviated _Wasm_) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable target for compilation of high-level languages like C/C++/Rust, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.

This page will be updated over time with more information relevant to Go's support for WebAssembly.
