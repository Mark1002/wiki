Editors with a COI should follow Wikipedia policies and best practices scrupulously:
* you should '''[[#howtodisclose|disclose]] your COI''' when involved with affected articles;
* you are '''strongly discouraged''' from editing affected articles directly;
* you may '''[[Wikipedia:Edit requests|propose changes]]''' on talk pages (by using the {{tlx|request edit}} template), or by posting a note at the [[WP:COIN|COI noticeboard]], so that they can be peer reviewed;
* you should put new articles through the [[WP:AFC|Articles for Creation (AfC)]] process instead of creating them directly;
* you should '''not act as a reviewer''' of affected article(s) at AfC, [[WP:NPP|new pages patrol]] or elsewhere;
* you should '''respect other editors''' by keeping discussions concise.

Note that no one on Wikipedia [[WP:OWN|controls articles]]. If Wikipedia hosts an article about you or your organization, others may add information that would otherwise remain little known. They may also decide to delete the article or decide to keep it should you later request deletion. The media has several times drawn attention to companies that engage in COI editing on Wikipedia (see [[Conflict-of-interest editing on Wikipedia]]), which has led to embarrassment for the organizations concerned.
