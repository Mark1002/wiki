# Configuring GoLand for WebAssembly (Wasm) projects

## Initial project configuration

When you first open or start a WebAssembly project in GoLand, it won't understand the "*syscall/js*" package.

That's easily fixable, by changing the **GOOS** and **GOARCH** values in the project settings, as per the screenshots below.

## Configuring build settings

With the initial project setup done, you'll probably want to configure the Build/Run settings next:
