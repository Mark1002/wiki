Hi,

My current version of go 1.14 has this vulnerability. I updated the version to 1.18 but still no resolve.

The description ofn the vulnerability says:
In Go before 1.14.14 and 1.15.x before 1.15.7, crypto/elliptic/p224.go can generate incorrect outputs, related to an underflow of the lowest limb during the final complete reduction in the P-224 field.

which indicates anything above 1.16 should resolve this.

Please help.
