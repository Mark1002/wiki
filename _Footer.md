Asking Questions
Unlike many projects, the Go project does not use GitHub Issues for general discussion or asking questions. GitHub Issues are used for tracking bugs and proposals only.

For asking questions, see:

The official Q&A channel for Google's Go Programming Language on Stack Overflow

Stack Overflow with questions tagged "go" or "golang" (complementing the Go Collective mentioned before)

The Go Forum, a web-based forum

Gophers Slack, use the invite app for access. The #general channel is a good starting point.

Go Community on Hashnode with questions and posts tagged with "go"

The golang-nuts mailing list

Subreddit for Go

IRC channel #go-nuts on Libera

If we closed your issue as a question with a link to this wiki, we apologize. Please ask the question on one of the above forums.
