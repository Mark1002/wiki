## Does anyone know how to resolve errors when downloading the mysql driver like this?

`$ go: inconsistent vendoring in C:\Go\src:
        github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql@v1.5.0: is explicitly required in go.mod, but not marked as explicit in vendor/modules.txt`

`run 'go mod vendor' to sync, or use -mod=mod or -mod=readonly to ignore the vendor directory`

> if anyone has experienced please share how to handle it please...
