# Asking Questions

Unlike many projects, the Go project does not use GitHub Issues for general discussion or asking questions (There is a proposal to allow questions, at [#23745](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/23745), which is currently being discussed). GitHub Issues are used for tracking bugs and [proposals](https://golang.org/s/proposal-process).

For asking questions, see:

* [The golang-nuts mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/golang-nuts)

* [The Go Forum](https://forum.golangbridge.org/), a web-based forum

* [Gophers Slack](https://gophers.slack.com), use the [invite app](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/) for access. The `#general` channel is a good starting point.

* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/go) with questions tagged "go"

* [Go Community on Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/n/go) with questions and posts tagged with "go"

* **IRC** channel #go-nuts on Freenode
