# Resources for New Speakers

Go needs everyone's help.
We want to see more new speakers with new perspectives at Go conferences,
especially more women and others underrepresented in the Go community.

The process of applying to speak at a tech conference can be a bit opaque and confusing 
for first-time speakers.
In general, please remember that, first and foremost,
conferences organizers want to find great talks;
there is no single format or recipe for a great talk;
and you need not be a Go expert to give a great talk.
All that you need to be is excited about sharing something
you've observed or learned about using Go.

Elsewhere on the wiki, we maintain a list of [upcoming conferences](Conferences), including links to CFPs,
along with past conferences, including talk videos.
