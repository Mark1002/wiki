# Developer Experience Working Group

Developer Experience Working Group is a team trying to make the Go programming language, libraries and tools more pleasant to use. The team primarily works on the Go project, even though its responsibilities and activities may involve contributing to the ecosystem-wide impactful projects. The group covers a highly specialized field of expertise that is not always well-covered by the core team.

## Goals

* Making Go a preferred language in industry and education.
* Helping the language graduate to a mainstream language by enabling the early majority developers.
* Helping Go to succeed in organizations that tend to have opinionated infrastructure and developer tooling.
