### What's happening?
To celebrate the release of Go 1.6 we're having a release party on February the 17th, 2016. 

#### Hang on, did you say Go 1.6 ships on the 17th of February?
Nope! Go 1.6 ships when it's ready. With that said, things are looking pretty good for a mid Feb release, so using the power of software estimation a date was plucked from the aether that happened to coincide with meetups already in the works.

### Sound's awesome, how can you get involved?
- If you host a Go user group or meetup, schedule a meetup on the 17th of Feb and celebrate. 
- If you're a member of a Go user group or meetup, pester your organiser and let them know you'd like to participate.

After the event post a photo, make a video, write a blog post, scribble on your facebook wall, or tweet something pity. Let's see how big we can make the celebration.

Don't forget to add your details :point_down: right here.

#### Who's involved?
Here is a list of the groups who are participating.

### What happens in a release party?
Go 1.6 is the 7th release of the language which has been open source since November 10th, 2009 -- that's 6.5 years!

### What'll happen if Go 1.6 comes out early?
It'll ruin the surprise, but only a little. Being realistic, even without the difficulty of timezones it's impossible to run every meetup at exactly the same time. As mentioned above, Feb 17 is an arbitrary date.

If you're a meetup organiser, Feb 17th would be great, but your participation is more important than being able to organise your group for exactly the 17th.

### What'll happen if Go 1.6 isn't our by the 17th?
Well ... at least we'll have each other. 

The feature set of Go 1.6 is fixed and isn't going to change in the next few weeks. Even if Go 1.6 ships after the 17th, it will be a little anticlimatic that we jumped the gun, but not a big deal.

### Who's organising this?
Well, if you run a Go meetup, you are. It can't be a worldwide release party without meetups around the globe.

#### No, seriously, who's organising this?
Here are the organisers so far:
