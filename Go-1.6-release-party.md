### What's happening?
To celebrate the release of Go 1.6 we're having a release party on February the 17th, 2016. 

#### Hang on, did you say Go 1.6 ships on the 17th of February?
Nope! Go 1.6 ships when it's ready. With that said, things are looking pretty good for a mid Feb release, so using the power of software estimation a date was plucked from the aether that happened to coincide with meetups already in the works.

### Sound's awesome, how can you get involved?
- If you host a Go user group or meetup, schedule a meetup on the 17th of Feb and celebrate. 
- If you're a member of a Go user group or meetup, pester your organiser and let them know you'd like to participate.

After the event post a photo, make a video, write a blog post, scribble on your facebook wall, or tweet something pity. Let's see how big we can make the celebration.

Don't forget to add your details :point_down: right here.

#### Who's involved?
Here is a list of the groups who are participating.
- [Sydney Go users' group](http://www.meetup.com/golang-syd/events/228276309/)

### What happens in a release party?
Go 1.6 is the 7th release of the language which has been open source since November 10th, 2009 -- that's 6.5 years since the project was open sourced and nearly 4 years since the 1.0 release.
A lot has changed in the language since 1.0, so this is a great opportunity to discuss the improvements landing 1.6 and the upcoming changes in 1.7.

_Please help by expanding this section so meetup organisers can share these details with their groups._

- HTTP/2.
  Go 1.6's `net/http` package supports HTTP/2 for both the Client and Server out of the box.
  [Here is a video of @bradfitz giving an overview of Go 1.6's HTTP/2 support](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gukAZO1fqZQ).
- Garbage Collector improvements.
  Go 1.6 focused heavily on improvements to the low latency collector shipped in Go 1.5.
  Rick Hudson gave a [presentation at GopherCon 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiv1JOfMjm0) describing the low latency collector delivered in Go 1.5, and gave hints to the improvements e  . Rick recently [recorded an interview with InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/interviews/hudson-go-gc) which focused on 1.6 in more detail.
- GOVENDOREXPERIMENT became the default.
  Go 1.5 added experimental support for a mechanism of including the source of your package's dependencies in the package itself, colloquially known as _vendoring_.

### What'll happen if Go 1.6 comes out early?
It'll ruin the surprise, but only a little. Being realistic, even without the difficulty of timezones it's impossible to run every meetup at exactly the same time. As mentioned above, Feb 17 is an arbitrary date.

If you're a meetup organiser, Feb 17th would be great, but your participation is more important than being able to organise your group for exactly the 17th.

### What'll happen if Go 1.6 isn't our by the 17th?
Well ... at least we'll have each other. 

The feature set of Go 1.6 is fixed and isn't going to change in the next few weeks. Even if Go 1.6 ships after the 17th, it will be a little anticlimatic that we jumped the gun, but not a big deal.

### Who's organising this?
Well, if you run a Go meetup, you are. It can't be a worldwide release party without meetups around the globe.

#### No, seriously, who's organising this?
Here are the organisers so far:
