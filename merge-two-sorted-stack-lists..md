write a method that takes as parameters two sorted stacks of integers s1 and s2 (where the lowest value is at the top) and returns a sorted stack (lowest on top) that contains the values of both s1 and s2. you are allowed to use only the stack operations such as pop, push, and top. you are allowed to use only stacks as temporary storage. no other data structures such as arrays are allowed. the header of the method is: public static stack merge sort stacks(stack s1, stack s2) write a main method in which you create two sorted stacks and call the above method to test it.
