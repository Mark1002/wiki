This page is a guide to help Go developers get started in order to contribute to `gopls`. For more information on `gopls`, see https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/gopls.

This page is currently under construction, but more information will be added here soon.

From https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/gopls#contributing:

> Contributions are welcome, but since development is so active, we request that you file an issue and claim it before starting to work on something. Otherwise, it is likely that we might already be working on a fix for your issue.

> All `gopls` issues are labeled as such (see the [gopls label](https://github.com/golang/go/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Agopls)). Available issues are also tagged `help wanted` (see them [here](https://github.com/golang/go/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Agopls+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+)). Before you begin working on an issue, please leave a comment that you are claiming it.
