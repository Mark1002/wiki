This page is a guide to help Go developers get started in order to contribute to `gopls`. For more information on `gopls`, see https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/gopls.

This page is currently under construction, but more information will be added here soon.

From https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/gopls#contributing:

> Contributions are welcome, but since development is so active, we request that you file an issue and claim it before starting to work on something. Otherwise, it is likely that we might already be working on a fix for your issue.

> Please see all available issues under the gopls label on the Go issue tracker. Any issue without an assignee and with the label "Suggested" is fair game - just assign yourself or comment on the issue before you begin working!
